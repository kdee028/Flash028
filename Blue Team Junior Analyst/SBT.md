## Introduction to OSINT
This section focused on exploring the tools and techniques for gathering information from publicly available sources to support cybersecurity defenses and threat intelligence efforts.

**TOOLS USED**
- Maltego: I used this tool after the lab to find the same information and setting the Sp1ritFyre Twitter handle as an entity to begin searching for other information.
- Base64
- Google

**METHODOLOGY**

To navigate through this segment. I begin by visiting the provided Twitter account, Sp1ritFyre. This account contained a link, which upon exploration lead to anu nexpected deade end. I then began investing the light bulb image prominently displated on the Twitter profile. This image me directed me towards a Facebook page. Although the intial discovery seemed promising, the Facebook account ultimately fell short of providing any leads on identifying the hacker. I then decided to turn to Google directly with the Twitter handle, Sp1ritFyre, as my search keyword. This unveiled a blog site.

Below, is a visual snapshot of the blog site.

I immediately noticed that it contain an image of the same lightbulb I discovered in the twitter account. Examining the send lead me to find the email d1ved33p@gmail.com and indicated that the blog belonged to a female. I then googled the email address and found another site displaying that the owner was female,had the username Sp1ritFyre and displayeed the same email address.

The name displayed is Sam Wood. I begin probing this site for additional information and viewed the archive section and discovered a github account. I then viewed the complete profile and found that her full name is Sammie Woods.

Reading the section her occupation is a Junior Penetration Tester and she is employed as Philman Security Inc. Reviewing the challenge tips, it expressed that some information may be decoded. I then then reflected back to the twitter account in which the link had no destination.

So, I entered the link into Base64 decoder.

I found that the website was redhunt.net and additional information displaying the associated email for the website used by the hacker.

This is an image of the questions included in the final capstone for the module in which I was required to enter to complete that section.

Steps to begin this lab consisted of:
1. Downloading TOR browser
2. Turning on a VPN
3. Then visiting the provided website, which allowed me to access the website seen in the image below.

I right clicked and inspected the website and utilized the console tab to find user credential by using 
-  generateUserCredentials()

Referencing the OSINT Framework for tools utilized cyberchef for decoding to find the username and password.

I then utilizsed these credentials to access the site's home page. I immediately noticed that several pages were encoded.

Using cyberchef, I discoved that this site says "Authentic Switzerland's choclate. You're tired of not finding good chocolate? This post is for you."

- Guns WANNA KNOW HOW TO BUY YOUR GUNS?, THIS IS FOR YOU
- Recreational Drugs Buying/Selling Let the party begins! (Everything you wanna know about drug dealing)
- Hey dude... wanna candy? (The real D king!)Deliver the package, collect the money and live like a king!
- BBB Organs for sale Are you such an alcoholic that your kidney stopped working? Don't worry, we can get you a new one

Further inspecting the site there was an image of a passport in which I utilized tp discover the name and country of the suspect.

## Introduction to Threat Hunting
In this section I learned proactive cybersecurity techniques aimed at detecting and mitigating threats before they exploit vulnerabilities within an organization's network.

**TOOLS USED**
- Redline
- Mandiant
- Powershell

In this image, I created the criteria for detecting IOC's such as the:
- File MD5 value
- File name 
- File size
- File Sha1sum

To facilitate the process of not having to collect the MD5 and SHA1 value. I utilized and script that would read in each file and output the value for MD5 and SHA. THe output of this script is provided below.

Provided below is IoC report scan ran in Redline. This report shows the hits from the reported IoCs that Redline used to scan for matches against the IoCs to identify potential signs of mailicous activity.
