**METHODOLOGY**

To complete this section I began by going to the provided twitter account Sp1ritFyre. There was a link provided on the twitter account, but it did not lead to any destination. I then decided to do a google search on the lightbulb image on the twitter account and discovered a facebook account. I found a facebook account, but I didn't seem to provide much information. I then googled the twitter handle Sp1ritFyre and found a blog site. Provided is a photo of my discovery below:

I immediately noticed that it contain an image of the same lightbulb I discovered in the twitter account. Examining the send lead me to find the email d1ved33p@gmail.com and indicated that the blog belonged to a female. I then googled the email address and found another site displaying that the owner was female,had the username Sp1ritFyre and displayeed the same email address.

The name displayed is Sam Wood.
I begin probing this site for additional information and viewed the archive section and discovered a github account. I then viewed the complete profile and found that her full name is Sammie Woods.

Reading the section her occupation is a Junior Penetration Tester and she is employed as Philman Security Inc. Reviewing the challenge tips, it expressed that some information may be decoded. I then then reflected back to the twitter account in which the link had no destination.

So, I entered the link into Base64 decoder.
