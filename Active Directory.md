## Active Directory Lab
**Description**
This project aims to simplify the setup and management of Active Directory (AD) environments. It includes scripts, configuration templates, and documentation designed to automate and streamline the deployment, management, and troubleshooting of Active Directory services. 

**Prerequisites**
- Windows Server 2019 or newer.
- PowerShell 5.1 or newer.
- VMWARE or Virtual Box

This guide outlines the detailed steps to set up an Active Directory environment on a Windows Server 2019 instance running in Oracle VM VirtualBox. This setup is crucial for creating a controlled, simulated network environment for testing and development purposes.

**Step 1: Install Windows Server 2019 on VirtualBox**

1. Start with a Virtual Machine: Ensure you have Oracle VM VirtualBox installed on your host machine. Create a new virtual machine (VM) and select "Windows Server 2019" as the operating system.
2. Adjust Network Settings: Configure two network adapters for the VM:
- Adapter 1: Set to NAT. This allows your server to access the internet for updates and software installations.
- Adapter 2: Set to Internal Network, aligning with the topology you're implementing. This facilitates communication within your virtualized network environment.

**Step 2: Initial VM Configuration**

Insert Guest Additions CD Image: Navigate to Devices > Insert Guest Additions CD Image within the VirtualBox interface to improve interaction between the host and the VM. This step enhances functionalities such as clipboard sharing and window scaling.
Install Guest Additions: Within the VM, open File Explorer and navigate to the CD drive containing the VirtualBox Guest Additions. Run the installer for AMD64 systems. Once the installation completes, shut down the VM to apply changes.

**Step 3: Network Configuration Inside the VM**

Access Network and Sharing Center: Within the VM, go to Control Panel > Network and Internet > Network and Sharing Center > Change adapter settings.
Identify the NAT Adapter: Right-click on the adapter listed as connected to the Internet, go to Status > Details, and note the IP address (it should be in the 10.0.X.X range). Rename this adapter to "Internet" for easier identification.
System Rename: Right-click on the Start button, select System, and rename the computer to "DC". Follow the prompts to restart the computer for the name change to take effect.

**Step 4: Configuring IP Address for the Internal NIC**

Set Static IP for Internal Network Adapter: Navigate back to Network and Sharing Center > Change adapter options. Right-click on the adapter you've designated for the internal network (not the one named "Internet"), and select Properties.
Configure IPv4 Settings: Select Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) and click Properties. Configure the following settings:
IP address: 172.16.0.1
Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
Default gateway: Leave this field empty, as we're configuring a static IP for internal network purposes.
Preferred DNS server: 127.0.0.1 (This points back to the DC itself, which will be configured as a DNS server during the Active Directory setup.)

## Powershel Script
Utilized to automate the process of creating user accounts in Active Directory from a list of names

**Overview of the Script**
1. Environment Setup: You start by setting the execution policy of PowerShell to Unrestricted to allow scripts to run. This step is crucial for environments that default to restricted execution policies, which could prevent the script from running.
2. Script Parameters:
- $PASSWORD_FOR_USERS defines a default password for all users created by this script. It's set to "Password1" in your example, which should ideally be replaced with a more secure password in a real-world scenario.
- $USER_FIRST_LAST_LIST gets the content of a file named names.txt located in the current directory. This file should contain the first and last names of the users you want to create, with each name on a new line.
3. Secure Password Conversion: The plaintext password is converted to a secure string, which is a requirement for setting the account password in Active Directory through PowerShell.
4. Creating an Organizational Unit (OU): The script creates a new OU named _USERS where all the user accounts will be placed. The -ProtectedFromAccidentalDeletion flag is set to $false, which means the OU can be deleted without requiring additional steps to remove deletion protection.
5. User Account Creation Loop: For each name in the names.txt file, the script:
- Splits the name into first and last names.
- Constructs a username by taking the first letter of the first name and appending the full last name, all in lowercase.
- Outputs a message indicating it's creating a user account for the username.
- Calls New-AdUser to create the new user account with the specified attributes and places it in the _USERS OU. Key parameters include the user's first name, surname, display name, an employee ID set to the username, and a flag to ensure the password never expires.
